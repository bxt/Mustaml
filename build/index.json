"pagetitle":"Mustaml",
"intro":"Mustaml is a html template language that aims to be best for creating modern web pages' markup and uses \"logic-less\" templates as known from {{ mustache }} plus pythonish indentation and shortcuts like HAML to build html-tags. ",
"desc":[
"I tried to bring the best of both worlds together and fix some stuff that annoyed me about either of them. With HAML it was the ruby-specific syntax all over the place, which made most implementations for other languages, namely JS, PHP and Java really incompatible and diverse. But I want to use my templates in all the corners AJAX applications have. ",
"Mustaml gets this pretty well. On the other hand I wanted to avoid the verbosity of double-mustaches and HTML tags that mustache templates suffer from. ",
"So I ended up cherry-picking the best HAML and mustache features and putting them together into a new language. "
